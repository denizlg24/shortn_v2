## 🎓 Why I Built This

Shortn was born from a real need in the marketplace. When Vida Económica, one of Portugal's most respected business publications, needed a reliable link management solution, existing platforms couldn't provide the combination of features, customization, and analytics they required.

What started as a solution for one client has evolved into a full-featured platform capable of serving businesses of all sizes. The system has successfully processed over 2.4 million clicks while maintaining 99.9% uptime and sub-second response times.

### Mission

To provide businesses and creators with enterprise-grade link management tools that are powerful yet accessible, with transparent pricing and exceptional performance.
